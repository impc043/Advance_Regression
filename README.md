## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- dataset being used: train.csv



## Conclusions
- We have build our model based on around 271 features, among them top 6 features are:
  - Neighborhood_Crawfor.
  - Functional_Typ.
  - Neighborhood_StoneBr.
  - MSZoning_RL.
  - SaleCondition_Normal.
  - GrLivArea.
- Error terms are normally distributed.
- R2_Score for Training data set: ``0.94``
- R2_Score for Testing data set: ``0.91``



## Technologies Used
- numpy 
- pandas 
- matplotlib.pyplot 
- seaborn
- sklearn
- statsmodels.api
